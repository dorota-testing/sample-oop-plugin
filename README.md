###What is it?
This is a sample OOP plugin based on https://wppb.me.
Sample plugin settings are added (text field, text area and images). One shortcode that prints all options is added.
Plugin settings have their own link in admin menu (as opposed to link as part of Settings submenu).

###Instalation
Download, move to your plugins directory and instal as usual.
